* Design system link, official [Orbit Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/rn3Smy3TgsqP8eRq5ZgVYV/%5BOrbit-Design-System%5D-Native-App-Components-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=L1t7aZcFRQsNptJP-1)
* I will be practising to create a new design system from the [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/rn3Smy3TgsqP8eRq5ZgVYV/%5BOrbit-Design-System%5D-Native-App-Components-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=L1t7aZcFRQsNptJP-1) file. But I will refer the original [orbit-compose](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit-compose) repo to make improvements to my code
